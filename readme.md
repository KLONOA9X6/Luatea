# Phase teleportation module

This module can teleport you to a predetermined location.

## **BUILD**

Unfortunately, although I had exported the module, I was unable to synthesize it due to the lack of some part.

## USAGE

Drop this module to someplace you want to teleport to. If you did it, the module screen will turn green. When you want to teleport to that location, just put the module to your deputy hand, and right click mouse. If all goes well, you'll be teleported to that location in three seconds.
